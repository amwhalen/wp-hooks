WP Hooks allows you to add JavaScript, CSS, meta tags, etc. to your
header and footer without modifying your theme.

== Description ==

WP Hooks is a plugin for WordPress that allows you to add JavaScript, HTML, or other code to your
header and footer without modifying your theme. WP Hooks uses the wp_head() and wp_footer() hooks
built in to WordPress to add content to your header and/or footer. It’s great for those who have
custom JavaScript, CSS, or other code (Google Analytics, meta tags, etc.) in their header or footer
and don’t want to or can't modify their theme.
